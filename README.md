# Cupid
The phonetic sound made by the acronym of 'quick-picture-display'.


This simple project is the result of a desire to have a picture viewing application that launches faster than the default Windows 10 application. It was built in C# using WPF, and supports image zooming and moving, and navigating with the arrowkeys. A filewatcher is used to update the local collection of image files.
